This repository contains code related to my "Stupid VDG Tricks" blog:

	http://vdgtricks.blogspot.com/

The source code is availble through Git, at the links available here:

	http://git.infradead.org/users/linville/vdgtricks.git

At present, it contains code to convert still images to a format
displayable on a CoCo in SG24 mode, 8-color G6C mode, and the 44-color
"flicker" mode created when combining the previous two modes at
runtime.

This is a project to accompany a blog.	Please don't expect
particularly "user friendly" results, at least not anytime soon.
Patches are welcome, if you want to improve the project.  With that
said, I have tidied things up a bit and I am now producing CLOADM'able
WAV files, LOADM'able BIN files, and a DECB diskette image.  These all
run on my NTSC CoCo and my Tano Dragon.  PAL machines will undoubtedly
produce disappointing results...

As-is, if you have a C compiler and mamou (and cecb, and decb) in your
PATH then all you need to do is run "make".  To change the picture,
copy whatever picture you want to use over to the name test.jpg and
re-run "make".

Well...enough for now!
